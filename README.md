Hello everyone, Myself Abhishek Jaiswal, currently pursuing diploma in computer science and engineering from Government Polytechnic Adityapur, Jamshedpur.
I just started learning CSE, and this is my first Creation.

In Coin.js, first random number (between 0 to 1) generate using random.math() then I used simple comparison If(number<0.5) Head else Tail.
Here I also count total flips and total head and tail percentage.


Here you will find 3 files :-

1) index.html
2) Coin.js
3) coin1.mp4

I hope you like this web application,
It is not new , but it is unique !
